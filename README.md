### Interesting salary trends on Stack Overflows survey 2020

When you are solving what is the average salary for a developer type youâ€™ll cross with this observation: Dataset has 23 different developer categories but this is a multiple-choice question so respondents can choose all that applies. This means for example that one respondent can have many developer types listed. There were 8269 different answer types (23 categories + 8264 different combinations of those categories). So how can you exactly tell, which salary is meant for each developer type?

Stack Overflow makes an Annual Developer Survey to their developer community. In 2020 with nearly 65,000 responses fielded from over 180 countries, their survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from technologies to education and salary levels.

In this notebook I will be exploring the 2020 Stack Overflow public survey. My study question will we be focused on technologies (languages), developer types salary and education. Main target group are those developers who describe them as professionals.

During the exploring phase I noticed interesting things in when respondents gave their answers for salary. This observation led me to examine salary question more deeply. 

There will be three study questions:

- What are the most common languages used by professionals?
- What is the average salary for each developer type?
- How does education compare to salary?
